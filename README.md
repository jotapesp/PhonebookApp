This is Phonebook app made using Python and SQL as database. The program is simple to use, on the command line just enter regular python commands and "app.py contacts.db" as the default database name is 'contacts.db' and it is located in the 'database' folder. The program will look for the 'contacts.db' file within the database folder by default. If you want to change the database, move it into the database folder and execute the commands in the commandline to run the app ([regular python commands] app.py [database_name].
